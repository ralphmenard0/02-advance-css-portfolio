Description
Create a deployed portfolio of work samples for review by potential employers.

Motivation
As I take first-steps in my career as a web developer, a well-designed portfolio, which showcases my work, skillsets, and values is invaluable to securing my first employment or internship.

This page will be updated and rebuilt over time, but is a wonderful opportunity to showcase my growing skillsets.

Learning Targets
This exercise required building a page from scratch using the HTML and CSS skills gained over the first three weeks of class. Infusing the page with a bit of my own personality while navigating nascent flex-box and media-query skills were this week's challenges met.

Core Objectives Met
Includes developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me.
Navigation links scroll to the appropriate corresponding sections.
The Work section includes titled images of my applications.
The first application's image in the Work section is larger in size than the others.
The application images link to deployed applications. (Note: At the time this was first published, I had just one portfolio item deployed. Additional applications will be added as Boot Camp progresses.)
The page responsively adapts to viewport sizing.
